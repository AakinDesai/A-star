# A-star

A* (pronounced as "A star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. The algorithm efficiently plots a walkable path between multiple nodes, or points, on the graph. 

A* works by making a lowest-cost path tree from the start node to the target node. What makes A* different and better for many searches is that for each node, A* uses a function f(n)f(n)f(n) that gives an estimate of the total cost of a path using that node. Therefore, A* is a heuristic function, which differs from an algorithm in that a heuristic is more of an estimate and is not necessarily provably correct.
